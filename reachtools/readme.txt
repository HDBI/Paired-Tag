=========================================================

As the library structure of Paired-tag and current version of Paired-seq is different from initial version of Paired-seq described in Zhu et.al., NSMB, 2019, please be aware to use the right version of reachtools.

This one is for Paired-tag/Paired-seq version 2020 only!
